# SuperMarioBros
#### Description: 
This is a Super Mario Bros. clone that I made using the SDL3 library in C++. In this version of Super Mario Bros., you can play World 1-1, and the gameplay is the same as the original game, except for the fire plant and Fire Mario. Star Mario animation is a bit different from the original, because I couldn't write it as I had intended. Lastly, there is a flag pool, but it is empty.
